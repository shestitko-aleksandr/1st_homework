		<p>Now I am Senior Software Engineer in someone industrial automation company in Minsk, live in Grodno.</p>
		<p>All the stages of my career path you can read <a href="http://career.ru/resume/face9e56ff022809d90039ed1f4d3233776648">on HH</a>.</p>
		<p>The situation in the industry is getting worse, it has become 
difficult to search customers and I want to find an alternative to my 
work.</p> 
		<p>I would like to try myself as a frontend developer.</p> 
		<p>First, I had to develop a lot of user interfaces. Of course, the 
ideology of building a user interface to the production management 
system is very different from a web site or a mobile application, but 
there are also many similarities. For example, as a rule, for control 
screens used html or xml and for the dynamics and animation – scripts. 
Often runtime environment uses IE engine :-). In most cases, industrial 
IDE for user interface design are WYSIWYG editors, generate markup by 
themself and the complexity of the scripts is not high, however....</p>
		<p>Secondly, I was bored this work and I've always wanted to do a frontend, but, simply, was not opportunity..... :-)</p>
		<p>I have some minimalist experience of web design. For example – <a href="http://maria-iskusnica.by/">maria-iskusnica.by</a>.
 Absolutely not a commercial project. Drupal 7, with free theme with minimal 
changes - put photo in header and smallest editing css + domain name 
registration and placement on hosting.</p> 
		<p>What I can do right now..... in preparation for writing this 
resume, I looked html, css, js, php. Fast :-). I can do layout  using 
css, read, understand and customise not very difficult  scripts. Aboute 
jquery, node.js and angularjs. I plan to watch them as soon as possible 
or during the probationary period. In any case, I need some practice.</p>
		<p>What are the chances?</p>
